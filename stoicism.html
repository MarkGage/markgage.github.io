<p><strong>Stoicism</strong> is a school of Hellenistic philosophy that flourished throughout the Roman and Greek world until the 3rd century <abbr title="Anno Domini">AD</abbr>. Stoicism is predominantly a philosophy of personal ethics that is informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness for humans is found in accepting that which we have been given in life, by not allowing ourselves to be controlled by our desire for pleasure or our fear of pain, by using our minds to understand the world around us and to do our part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others in a fair and just manner.</p>

			<details><summary>Zeno of Citium</summary>
				<p>Zeno of Citium (c. 334–c. 262 BC) was a Hellenistic thinker from Citium, Cyprus, and probably of Phoenician descent. Zeno was the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy, which he taught in Athens from about 300 BC. Based on the moral ideas of the Cynics, Stoicism laid great emphasis on goodness and peace of mind gained from living a life of Virtue in accordance with Nature. It proved very successful, and flourished as the dominant philosophy from the Hellenistic period through to the Roman era.</p></details>
			<details><summary>Epictetus</summary>
				<p>Epictetus (c. AD 50–135) was a Greek Stoic philosopher. He was born a slave at Hierapolis, Phrygia (present day Pamukkale, Turkey) and lived in Rome until his banishment, when he went to Nicopolis in northwestern Greece for the rest of his life. His teachings were written down and published by his pupil Arrian in his <i>Discourses</i> and <i>Enchiridion</i>.</p>
<p>Epictetus taught that philosophy is a way of life and not just a theoretical discipline. To Epictetus, all external events are beyond our control; we should accept calmly and dispassionately whatever happens. However, individuals are responsible for their own actions, which they can examine and control through rigorous self-discipline.</p></details>
			<details><summary>Seneca</summary>
				<p>Seneca the Younger (c. 4 BC–AD 65), fully Lucius Annaeus Seneca and also known simply as Seneca, was a Roman Stoic philosopher, statesman, dramatist, and—in one work—humorist of the Silver Age of Latin literature. As a tragedian, he is best-known for his <i>Medea</i> and <i>Thyestes</i>.</p>
<p>He was a tutor and later advisor to emperor Nero. He was forced to take his own life for alleged complicity in the Pisonian conspiracy to assassinate Nero. However, some sources state that he may have been innocent. His father was Seneca the Elder, his elder brother was Lucius Junius Gallio Annaeanus, and his nephew was the poet Lucan.</p></details>
			<details><summary>Marcus Aurelius</summary>
				<p>Marcus Aurelius (26 April 121–17 March 180 AD) was Emperor of Rome from 161 to 180. He ruled with Lucius Verus as co-emperor from 161 until Verus's death in 169. Marcus Aurelius was the last of the so-called Five Good Emperors. He was a practitioner of Stoicism, and his untitled writing, commonly known as <i>Meditations</i>, is a significant source of the modern understanding of ancient Stoic philosophy, and is considered by many commentators to be one of the greatest works of philosophy.</p></details></aside>

	  <h2>Origins of Stoicism</h2>
	<p>The Stoic school of philosophy was founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century <abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>. The Stoics taught that emotions resulted in errors of judgment that were destructive, due to the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom, and the belief that it is virtuous to maintain a will (called <i class="greek">prohairesis</i>) that is in accord with nature. Because of this, the Stoics presented their philosophy as a way of life (<i class="latin">lex divina</i>), and they thought that the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how that person behaved. To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they taught that everything was rooted in nature.</p>
		<aside class="pquote">
    <blockquote>
        <p>Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.</p>
    </blockquote>

	  <h2>Late Stoicism</h2>
<p>Later Stoics&mdash;such as Seneca and Epictetus&mdash;emphasized that, because "virtue is sufficient for happiness," a sage was immune to misfortune. This belief is similar to the meaning of the phrase "stoic calm," though the phrase does not include the "radical ethical" Stoic views that only a sage can be considered truly free, and that all moral corruptions are equally vicious.</p>
<p>From its founding, Stoic doctrine was popular during the Roman Empire&mdash;and its adherents included the emperor Marcus Aurelius. It later experienced a decline after Christianity became the state religion in the 4th century. Over the centuries, it has seen revivals, notably in the Renaissance and in the modern era.</p>

	  <h2>Etymology</h2>
	<p><em>Stoic</em> comes from the Greek <i class="greek">stōïkos</i>, meaning of the portico. This, in turn, comes from <em>stoa</em>, the painted portico, in reference to where the influential Stoic Zeno of Citium taught&mdash;his front porch.</p>
