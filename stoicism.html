  <h1>Stoicism</h1>
<p><strong>Stoicism</strong> is a school of Hellenistic philosophy that flourished throughout the Roman and Greek world until the 3rd century <abbr title=“Anno Domini”>AD</abbr>. Stoicism is predominantly a philosophy of personal ethics that is informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness for humans is found in accepting that which we have been given in life, by not allowing ourselves to be controlled by our desire for pleasure or our fear of pain, by using our minds to understand the world around us and to do our part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others in a fair and just manner.</p>
<p>It was founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century <abbr title=“Before Christ”>BC</abbr>. The Stoics taught that emotions resulted in errors of judgment that were destructive, due to the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom, and the belief that it is virtuous to maintain a will (called <i class="greek">prohairesis</i>) that is in accord with nature. Because of this, the Stoics presented their philosophy as a way of life (<i class="latin">lex divina</i>), and they thought that the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how that person behaved. To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they taught that everything was rooted in nature.</p>
<p>Later Stoics&mdash;such as Seneca and Epictetus&mdash;emphasized that, because "virtue is sufficient for happiness," a sage was immune to misfortune. This belief is similar to the meaning of the phrase "stoic calm," though the phrase does not include the "radical ethical" Stoic views that only a sage can be considered truly free, and that all moral corruptions are equally vicious.</p>
<p>From its founding, Stoic doctrine was popular during the Roman Empire&mdash;and its adherents included the emperor Marcus Aurelius. It later experienced a decline after Christianity became the state religion in the 4th century. Over the centuries, it has seen revivals, notably in the Renaissance and in the modern era.</p>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
	<p><em>Stoic</em> comes from the Greek <i class="greek">stōïkos</i>, meaning of the portico. This, in turn, comes from <em>stoa</em>, the painted portico, in reference to where the influential Stoic Zeno of Citium taught&mdash;his front porch.</p>
