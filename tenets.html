	<h1>Basic Tenets</h1>
	<p>The Stoics provided a unified account of the world, consisting of formal logic, monistic physics and naturalistic ethics. Of these, they emphasized ethics as the main focus of human knowledge, though their logical theories were of more interest for later philosophers.</p>
<p>Stoicism teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive emotions; the philosophy holds that becoming a clear and unbiased thinker allows one to understand the universal reason (<i class="greek">logos</i>). A primary aspect of Stoicism involves improving the individual's ethical and moral well-being. In his <cite>A History of Western Philosophy</cite>, Bertrand Russell wrote that "virtue consists in a will that is in agreement with Nature" (p. 264). This principle also applies to the realm of interpersonal relationships. Rusell described this viewpoint as to "be free from anger, envy, and jealousy," and to accept even slaves as "equals of other men, because all men alike are products of nature"(p. 253).</p>

<p>The Stoic ethic espouses a deterministic perspective; in regard to those who lack Stoic virtue, Cleanthes once opined that the wicked man is "like a dog tied to a cart, and compelled to go wherever it goes." A Stoic of virtue, by contrast, would amend his will to suit the world and remain, in the words of Epictetus, "sick and yet happy, in peril and yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy," (Bertrand Russell, <cite>A History of Western Philosophy</cite>, p. 264) thus positing a "completely autonomous" individual will, and at the same time a universe that is "a rigidly deterministic single whole." This viewpoint was later described as "Classical Pantheism" and was adopted by Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza.</p>
<p>Stoicism became the foremost popular philosophy among the educated elite in the Hellenistic world and the Roman Empire, to the point where, in the words of Gilbert Murray "nearly all the successors of Alexander &hellip; professed themselves Stoics."</p>
